# Tic-Tac-Toe

[Tic-Tac-Toe] (Link) is a website containing an interactive but easy and fun game of X's and O's with the player competing against the computer. 

## Table of contents


### [User experience](#user-experience)
The game uses minimalist design to ensure the game is easy to understand and play. The game is player against computer and there is a scoareboard to also track games won and lost. The player represents 'X' and always makes the first move. Meanwhile the computer is always 'O' and will always go second.

### [Design](#design)
* Typography
 The font styling throughout the website is mainly 'Georgia' and 'Sans Serif'. 

 * Game area
 The game area consists of a 3x3 grid with each players details such as score and symbol to their respective sides. 

 * Footer
 The footer at the bottom is the opposite color to the rest of the interface to draw the users attention to how the game is played. 

 * Wireframes
  *Mainly a pen and notebook were used to structure the site.

### [Features Left to Implement](#features-left-to-implement)
* Improved computer logic
I would like to implement some logic within the makeComputerMove function to improve it's ability to attack and defend instead of picking random cells to choose.  
*  I would also consider making it a best of series such as best of 5 or even 7 but the idea of an infinity game would appeal to a lot of people as it is quite relaxing and used mainly for fun. 
* modals?

### Javascript
The Javascript code for Tic-Tac-Toe contains comments explaining the reasoning behind the functions and functions used. The handleCellClick and makeComputerMove functions are essential to how the game is played. However the checkWinner function is the most essential as this loops through each possible winning combination, it then destrcutures each combination array into 'a','b' and'c'. If the values at 'a','b' and 'c' are all the same it determines a winner. If no winner is found in the loop but all cells on the board are full it will result in a tie. The function for processTurn is also very important with the flow of the game and the setTimeout function allows a delay just after the player move and before the computer makes it's move to add a more steady flow to the game.
