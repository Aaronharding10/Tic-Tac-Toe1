    <p>
    The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. 
    Player is known as X and the computer is O. 
    Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. 
    X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
